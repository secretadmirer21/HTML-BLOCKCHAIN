    <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via <mark>cryptographic hashes</mark>.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup><br><br> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[10]</sup> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.<sup>[13]</sup>

       <br> <br> The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<sup>[4]</sup> The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<sup>[3]</sup>
    </p>

    <H2>Structure and design</H2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A blockchain is a <mark> decentralized, distributed</mark>, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup> This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[21]</sup> A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a <mark>peer-to-peer </mark>network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by <mark>mass collaboration</mark> powered by <mark>collective self-interests</mark>.<sup>[22]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[23] </sup>A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Blocks</h3>
    
    <p>
        Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<sup>[3]</sup> Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).[26][27] To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[28]
    <br> <br>
    Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[27] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever.
    </p>

    <h4>Block time</h4>
    <p>
        The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for <mark>Ethereum</mark> is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.<sup>[33]</sup>
    </p>

    <h4>Hard forks</h4>

    <p>
         <i>This section is an excerpt from <em> Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork</em>.</i> <br> <br>
         A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward-compatible and requires all users to upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.
    <br> <br>
         For example, <mark1>Ethereum</mark1> was hard-forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in <mark>The DAO</mark>, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.<sup>[34]</sup>
    <br> <br>     
         A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin Cash.[35] The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate for demand.<sup>[36]</sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Decentralization</h3>
    <p>By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held centrally.<sup>[3]</sup> The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.<sup>[37]</sup>
        <br>
        <br>

        In a so-called "51% attack" a central entity gains control of more than half of a network and can then manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing double-spending.<sup>[38]</sup>
        <br><br>
        Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.[39]: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.<sup>[3]</sup>

    <h4>Finality</h4>

    <p>
        Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is "finalized") and thus can be trusted. Most distributed blockchain protocols, whether proof of work or proof of stake, cannot guarantee the finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on "probabilistic finality": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.<sup>[43]</sup>
        <br>
        <br>
    <mark>Byzantine Fault Tolerance</mark>-based proof-of-stake protocols purport to provide so called "absolute finality": a randomly chosen validator proposes a block, the rest of validators vote on it, and, if a supermajority decision approves it, the block is irreversibly committed into the blockchain.[43] A modification of this method, an "economic finality", is used in practical protocols, like the Casper protocol used in Ethereum: validators which sign two different blocks at the same position in the blockchain are subject to "slashing", where their leveraged stake is forfeited.<sup>[43]</sup>
    </p>

    <h3>Openness</h3>

    <p>
        Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.<sup>[44][45][46][47][48]</sup> Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any <b>data structure</b> that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.<sup>[49]</sup> Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.<sup>[50]: 30–31 </sup> Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.<sup>[44][46]</sup> Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."<sup>[8][51]</sup>

    <h4>Permissionless (public) blockchain</h4>
    <p>
        An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no <mark>access control</mark> is needed.<sup>[29]</sup> This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a <mark>transport layer</mark>.<sup>[29]</sup>
        <br><br>
    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses <mark>Hashcash puzzles</mark>. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by <mark>Adam Back</mark>, the original idea was first proposed by <mark>Cynthia Dwork</mark> and <mark>Moni Naor</mark> and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".
    <br>    <br>
    In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.<sup>[52]</sup> Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.
    </p>


    <H4>Permissioned (private) blockchain</H4>
    <p>
        Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.<sup>[53]</sup> It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.<sup>[9]</sup>
    </p>

    <h4>Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain</h4>
    <p>
        Nikolai Hampton argued in <i><mark>Computerworld</mark></i> that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."<sup>[8]</sup> This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a <mark>financial crisis</mark> or <mark>debt crisis</mark> like the <mark>financial crisis of 2007–08</mark>, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,<sup>[54]</sup> and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using <mark>gigawatts</mark> of computing power — it's time-consuming and expensive."<sup>[8]</sup> He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases."<sup>[8]</sup>
    </p>


    <h4>Blockchain analysis</h4>
    <p>
        The <mark>analysis of public blockchains</mark> has become increasingly important with the popularity of <mark>bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin</mark> and other <mark>cryptocurrencies</mark>.<sup>[55]</sup> A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and banks.[56][57] The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc.<sup>[58]</sup> A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is changing and now specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as Monero.<sup></sup>[59][60][61]</sup> The question is about the public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of the very same data. It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in the blockchain.<sup>[62]</sup>
